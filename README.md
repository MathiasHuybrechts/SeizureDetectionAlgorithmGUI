# Seizure Detection Algorithm GUI
This project came about thanks to a collaboration between KU Leuven and UZ Leuven. The main.ipynb file allows a selected EDF file to be read and graphically represented using a GUI in voil√†. The data from the EDF file is processed and checked for epileptic seizures. Thanks to the integrated epilepsy detection algorithm, the processing time of nursing staff can be greatly reduced in a hospital setting.  

The pickle file consists of non-patient-specific filter coefficients for a pre-trained SPIR filter. This allows for rapid processing of the data with acceptable accuracy. 
The requirements.txt file contains all the necessary dependencies to run the GUI
